Why does Wolf Howl in the Night

A myth submitted to the site by Diablo Gato 
The Sherwood Forest of Nottingham, India
Why is the moon so alone? it is because there once used to be a lover of moon in the spirit world whose name was 'Quae Carcajou' they used to be together and used to walk the skies together. Every one was jealous of the relationship between the moon and Quae Carcajou that they all wanted them to be separated so there was a spirits called trickster who tricked spirits alot by using his wicked mind that was gifted to him. The trickster was the most jealous spirit in all of the spirits who were jealous of the relationship. 

The trickster planned a very cunning plan to break the relationship, he told Quae Carcajou that moon wanted some wild roses form the normal world and so took off Quae Carcajou to bring back some wild roses from the spirit world but little did he know that if you leave the spirit world you cannot come back. 

When Quae Carcajou came back to the spirit world door he could not go in, then came master Avatar the controller of the spirit world he felt sad for Quae Carcajou but since his powers could not work on the outside world so he gave the trickster jail for his whole life and the moon was so sad that she used her whole light power to Quae Carcajou so he could ask a powerful boon from master Avatar. 

The moon took sun's help in getting the light and so Quae Carcajou asked for a boon to turn into a wolf because when he went to the forest of Sherwood he saw the harsh ways of men, how they cut trees, how they kill animals and are merciless to poor people. He saw how very harshly they cut a wolf to get it's fur and just for eating it, that is why Quae Carcajou chose a wolf because he wanted to help the wolf tribe in some way. He did help the wolf tribe by making fear into the hearts of people, he did something and the conclusion came out good, when ever a wolf would show its four big teethes it is a better option to run but not hit it or kill it. But Quae Carcajou still loves moon so much, at night when he sees moon he goes to cliff top and howls her name "MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNN" 
He can be at two places at a time can travel very fast because the wolf tribe had a magical power that would be given to the perfect one in the tribe. So now you know 

Second Story Of Wolf 
There was a Wolf who, like most of her kind, loved the Moon. This Wolf, however, found profound joy in the Moon’s soft light that she found nowhere else — not in the hunt, not in her pack — only in her Moon. She danced in his light and sang with abandon whenever he shone upon her. The Moon looked down at this Wolf who loved him and he fell in love with her and her beautiful song to him.

The Wolf believed she could possess the Moon, some day, either by his design or hers. When she sang her joyous songs, she sang of “some day…some day…” The Moon agreed and promised in soft whispers, “some day…some day…” for he was much in love with his Wolf.

One early morning while Wolf slept, exhausted after a song- and Moon-filled night, the Moon began his descent from the sky. That dawn, as he often did, he met the sky ruler, the Sun. The Sun’s growing light all but removed the Moon’s face from the sky, and Moon bowed respectfully.

“Ah Moon,” said the Sun, growing brighter, “I have been wanting to talk to you.” The Moon paused to listen, though he was a bit impatient to be gone. Moon did not dislike the Sun, but he had always believed that the Sun needed to learn more about subtlety. No one, he reasoned, ever got a Moon-burn.

“I have heard,” continued the Sun, growing brighter still, “strange reports from Sister Earth about you, stories of how you, in trying to leave your orbit, have caused great upheaval upon her surface. Is this true?” The Moon paled, remembering the tidal floods his attempted deviation from his orbit had caused.

“Only once did I attempt such a thing,” replied the Moon with quiet dignity.

“But” asked the Sun, “do you not once again plan such an attempt?” Moon was astounded. Who had told Sun such a thing, since it was something he had only whispered to himself in the night, something he had not even begun to figure out how to do. In reply, Moon was silent, answer enough for the Sun.

“Know this,” thundered the Sun, now risen bright in the sky, “that if you ever do attempt such a thing, you will certainly destroy sister Earth and all upon her.” At this, the Moon paled to invisibility. He did not wish to hear more, yet the Sun continued.

“Your orbit is preordained, one from which you cannot stray.” The Sun was quiet a moment, and then continued.

“Once,” he told Moon, “I too loved an Earth creature and wished to be near her. I sent her a kiss that not only destroyed her and all her family but completely wiped her species from the Earth. It took Sister Earth many eons to overcome my mistake.”

The Moon listened, incredulous, at what the Sun told him, and he suddenly felt a new respect for this bright being. With this respect came the sinking knowledge that what the Sun was telling him was true. As he slipped from sight, he heard the Sun one last time before he slipped around the Earth to ride the dark sky alone.

“Love her from a distance, my friend,” he heard the Sun say, “for to try to do more would cause her and all her kind much harm.”

The next night, the Wolf sat quietly in the Moon’s full light, singing of her love for him. As always, the Moon’s soft light fell around her, and she could almost feel his touch. That night, the Wolf was overjoyed to see her Moon, until she heard the words he whispered, words very different than any he had ever said before.  She sat in frozen silence as her Moon whispered a terrible thing.

“You, my beautiful Wolf and I, your Moon must remain apart — always.”

Wolf burst into a heartbreaking, keening howl.  Moon waited patiently to speak again.  When he saw her grief, he nearly broke his promise to the Sun.  He longed to comfort her.  Instead he whispered that perhaps — some day — it would come to pass that they could find a way to each other. For now, he told her, and perhaps for a very long time, she must learn to stop longing for him.

Wolf knew that Moon was only being kind in saying “perhaps some day.” She knew it was forever.

Wolf-Pack

Later, after a frenzied and savage hunt, as she lay sleeping, she had a vivid dream. She dreamed she was under the full Moon, bathed once again in his light, singing with all her heart to him. She felt again the joy she had always felt with her Moon — better than the hunt, better than her pack, better than anything she had ever known in her life. Suddenly, as she did in the past, she leaped from the edge of a high mountain, trying to jump on the Moon. Almost, she seems to touch him, and then she is plummeting down, down, down…into blackness.

Wolf awoke, startled from her dream by the massive impact of her landing.  She began to weep quietly as she remembered how she learned not to jump, finally, and to only sit still in the night and gaze at him, content with loving him from the distance. She remembered being content to wait for him to come to her every night.

Wolf cried for the memories the dream evoked. Then, when she was still, she came to understand that the dream had come from her most wild self to give her a message:

“You once learned to stop trying to jump on the Moon. Now you must learn to stop waiting for the Moon to come to you. It can never be.”

The next night, when the Moon returned to her, she asked, one last time,

“Can it be?” In her heart, she already knew his answer.

The Moon whispered tenderly,  “It can never be, my Wolf. It can never be.” The Wolf heard the deep pain in Moon’s voice, and Wolf and Moon cried together for what could never be.

The Wolf’s pain taught her a lesson. She knew, at last, that it was perfectly beautiful for the Wolf to fall in love with the Moon. It was perfectly wonderful for the Moon to love the song the Wolf sang every night, even if they must exist in entirely different realities — Earthbound Wolf and celestial Moon. It was perfectly good that they learned to love each other — Moon and Wolf — with reckless abandon.

The Wolf tried to jump to her Moon. The Moon tried to leave his orbit to touch his Wolf.  Moon and Wolf learned, and taught each other, that even if either had been able to leave their existences to go to the other one, it would bring grave consequences, not only for themselves but for the world as well. Wolf would die in the Moon’s airless space, and Moon would cause massive upheaval on Earth if he had changed his path around it.

Wolf and Moon learned something else. They learned that they would carry the joy that their love brought them, as well as the pain of their parting, forever. The Moon would always carry the song of the Wolf. The Wolf would carry the soft light of the Moon in her song. They would always love each other, not just for the light, or for the song, but for the lesson of Life and Love they shared together.

THE END.
